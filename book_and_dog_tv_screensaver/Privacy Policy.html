            shares information through our apps on Roku and Amazon Fire TV platforms (the “Service”). We recognize the
            importance of protecting personal information, especially when our apps may be used by children and
            families.</p>
        <p>By using our apps, you agree to the practices described in this Policy.</p>

        <h2>Data We May Access</h2>
        <p>We do not collect personal data directly from users through our apps. However, some technical information may
            be accessed automatically through platforms or third-party services such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device type and model</li>
            <li>Operating system</li>
            <li>Language and region</li>
            <li>Usage statistics (e.g., which games are played and for how long)</li>
            <li>IP address (which may be temporarily accessed for ad delivery)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data may be collected by Roku Analytics, Google Analytics, or ad networks integrated into our apps
            (e.g., Google Ad Manager, Roku Advertising Framework) to improve app functionality and show relevant ads.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Ads & Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We display ads through third-party advertising partners, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Ad Manager</li>
            <li>Roku Advertising Framework</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These partners may temporarily access the IP address or device ID in order to serve appropriate ad content.
            We do not store, retain, or sell this information ourselves.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Some of our apps are suitable for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
            children. Any local gameplay information (such as scores or preferences) is stored only on the device and is
            not transmitted to us.</p>
        <p>If we learn that a child under 13 has submitted personal information, we will delete it as soon as possible.
            Parents can contact us at <a
                href="mailto:help.freewindsoftware@gmail.com">help.freewindsoftware@gmail.com</a> with any concerns.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Cookies & Analytics</h2>
        <p>Our apps may use third-party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, which utilize tracking technologies
            like cookies or SDKs. These are used to understand general user behavior and improve the Service, but we do
            not use this data to personally identify any user.</p>
        <p>You can opt out of data tracking by contacting us at the email above.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Data Security & Retention</h2>
        <p>We do not store or retain any personal data. Any temporary technical data accessed (e.g., for ads) is handled
            by the respective platforms or ad services. We rely on the security measures of those providers (such as
            Roku and Google) to protect your information.</p>
